## Goals

The goal of this project is to provide a user interface for managing chess engines.
In particular, we want to focus on ergonomic chess engine development.

Hence, we're interested in providing functionality to debug a chess engine and to compare it against others in order to improve.

## License

Contrary to most Rust/Bevy projects, this project is licensed under [**GNU Affero General Public License v3**](LICENSE-AGPL) or later.
This is to align with other open source chess projects, like [Lichess](https://lichess.org/).

On the other hand, we plan to release more generally usable parts of the project under MIT/Apache-2.0.
We also encourage to contribute back to fishpond's dependencies, most of which are MIT/Apache-2.0 licensed.
